# Literary Lane - Book Buying Website

![Literary Lane](screenshot.png)

**Literary Lane** is a web application built using Next.js, Zustand for state management, MongoDB for the database, Tailwind CSS for styling, GSAP for animations, and SVG filters to enhance the user experience. It is a clone of the Counter-Print website and serves as a platform for buying books. This project showcases my skills in front-end development, user interface design, state management, and integration with a backend database.
