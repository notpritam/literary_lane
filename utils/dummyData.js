Through letters, documents, drawings, and family photographs, Alvar and Aino’s grandson tells the stories of their life together, in Finland and abroad, drawing on many of the never-before-published letters they sent to each other and to family, friends, and colleagues, until Aino’s death in 1949. The first monograph to specifically examine and celebrate the life and work of Aino and Alvar as a shared endeavour, this personal and intimate look at the unconventional lives of one of the most influential design couples of the twentieth century has been warmly and accessibly written by Aino and Alvar’s grandson, who has drawn on the family’s largely unpublished archive, including personal letters, snapshots, and sketches.

    Flexible Visual Systems is the design manual for contemporary visual identities. It teaches you a variety of approaches on how to design flexible systems, adjustable to any aesthetic or project in need of an identifiable visual language.
    
    To learn how to design flexible systems is not just learning another craft, it is going to change the way you think and work entirely. It is an approach, how to design. If you would place system design into a curriculum it would be the foundation course, putting you in the right mindset. You can apply the systemic approach to any discipline you will later specialise in, from corporate design, communication design, user experience design to textile design.
    
    The book is divided into three parts. The first part is a richly illustrated theoretic introduction (82 pages) explaining the past, present and future of flexible systems. It describes how they were used in the past, how they are used today and why they should not just organise formal solutions, but the way how we work.
    
    The second part is a hands-on, almost purely visual, description of how to design flexible systems on form, starting with a circle, triangle, square, pentagon and hexagon. Lots of instruction manuals and examples on how to use them on 148 pages!
    
    The third part explains how transformation processes can become flexible systems for visual identities. Especially creative coders,`,

    The Japanese artist’s pioneering career spans seven decades and she is now a global phenomenon. Her hallucinatory paintings, sculptures, and immersive environments invite us to join her very personal artistic investigation into the big cosmic questions of human existence.
    
    This is the first ever publication dedicated to the artist’s inflatable artworks – her fantastical large-scale balloon environments (1996 ongoing) that appear to defy gravity and that beguilingly play with our sense of space and scale, mind and body, reality and illusion.
    
    Richly illustrated, with a new essay by poet and critic Akira Tatehata; a new interview with Yayoi Kusama about her ‘balloons’; a new conversation between psychotherapist Philippa Perry and neuroscientist Professor Anil Seth about Kusama’s perceptual magic; and a complete illustrated history of Kusama’s inflatable artworks.`,

But, seen in a longer perspective, the planets, and their satellites, have exciting lives, full of events - for example, did you know that Saturn's moon, Titan, boasts lakes which contain liquid methane surrounded by soaring hills and valleys, exactly as the earth did before life evolved on our fragile planet? Or that Mercury is the shyest planet? Or, that Mars' biggest volcano is 100 times the size of Earth's, or that its biggest canyon is 10 times the depth of the Grand Canyon, or that it wasn't always red, but blue?
