    title: "À PEU PRÈS EUCLIDE",
    price: "19.00",
    des: `À peu près Euclide is a graphic and chromatic exploration of the language of Oliver Byrne, author of a treatise celebrating the marriage of art and science in 1850.

      Laurent Millet conjures up the vocabularies of the avant-gardes of the 20th century or the Memphis movement, but also, happily, that of childhood, with photographic prints using the gum bichromate process which gives them a graphic quality that is difficult to identify.

    title: "AINO + ALVAR AALTO: A LIFE TOGETHER",
    price: "20",
    des: `Aino and Alvar Aalto together founded Artek and created some of the most celebrated objects and buildings of the twentieth century. Through letters, documents, drawings, and family photographs, Alvar and Aino’s grandson tells the stories of their life together, in Finland and abroad, drawing on many of the never-before-published letters they sent to each other and to family, friends, and colleagues, until Aino’s death in 1949. The first monograph to specifically examine and celebrate the life and work of Aino and Alvar as a shared endeavour, this personal and intimate look at the unconventional lives of one of the most influential design couples of the twentieth century has been warmly and accessibly written by Aino and Alvar’s grandson, who has drawn on the family’s largely unpublished archive, including personal letters, snapshots, and sketches.
